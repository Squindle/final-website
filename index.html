        <h2>Typography Reflection Paragraphs</h2>
        <p>Transitional typography is an effective typographic system since it guides a viewers eyes across a pitch in a certain way which the designer can decide. This means you can present information in a way that looks nice while not missing out on the fact that it needs to be read in a certain way. Modular typography is useful since it is aesthetically pleasing due to the neat nature of this system. It also allows for things to be broken up into boxes which breaks the text up into smaller easier to read sections. Axial typography is interesting since it requires an axis to be chosen on the page. The rest of the text must then come off that axis. This creates a nice margin for the rest of the text to stem from and clearly shows the main part that should be seen first and guides a viewers eyes to that. Bilateral typography is a more neat way of organising copy in a piece. It also has clear hierarchy of text which shows the viewer what should be read first. This means when creating it the designer can clearly structure the text to fit what is more important to be known. Random typography is different from other typographic systems since it has no rules and connotations. This can create a very interesting and eye-catching piece that makes a viewer more interested to look. Radial typography has some differences from many of the other typographic systems. It involves circles quite heavily and then involves having information radiate from a circle. This does create an interesting and attention grabbing graphic and does have a clear hierarchy. Grid typography is one of the most simple and effective types of typography. It revolves around the construction of a grid on the page which you place text into. This makes it very aesthetically pleasing and simple to read. It creates a satisfying and well layed out piece. Dilatational typography is another system which heavily involves circles. This system has a primary central circle with the main copy inside as well as other larger circles around the main one. This creates a nice aesthetically pleasing piece. A problem is due to some of the text being upside down it may be harder to read.
