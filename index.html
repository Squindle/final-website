             The aim of this task utilising typography was to explore the different effectiveness and differences between different typographic systems. We had to create an example of all of the systems displayed above and think about the pros and cons of each as well as learning how to use the different systems and how to use conventions and structure to create effective pieces.Transitional typography is an effective typographic system since it guides a viewers eyes across a pitch in a certain way which the designer can decide. This means you can present information in a way that looks nice while not missing out on the fact that it needs to be read in a certain way. Modular typography is useful since it is aesthetically pleasing due to the neat nature of this system. It also allows for things to be broken up into boxes which breaks the text up into smaller easier to read sections. Axial typography is interesting since it requires an axis to be chosen on the page. The rest of the text must then come off that axis. This creates a nice margin for the rest of the text to stem from and clearly shows the main part that should be seen first and guides a viewers eyes to that. Bilateral typography is a more neat way of organising copy in a piece. It also has clear hierarchy of text which shows the viewer what should be read first. This means when creating it the designer can clearly structure the text to fit what is more important to be known. Random typography is different from other typographic systems since it has no rules and connotations. This can create a very interesting and eye-catching piece that makes a viewer more interested to look. Radial typography has some differences from many of the other typographic systems. It involves circles quite heavily and then involves having information radiate from a circle. This does create an interesting and attention grabbing graphic and does have a clear hierarchy. Grid typography is one of the most simple and effective types of typography. It revolves around the construction of a grid on the page which you place text into. This makes it very aesthetically pleasing and simple to read. It creates a satisfying and well layed out piece. Dilatational typography is another system which heavily involves circles. This system has a primary central circle with the main copy inside as well as other larger circles around the main one. This creates a nice aesthetically pleasing piece. A problem is due to some of the text being upside down it may be harder to read.

    <h2>Contrast, Alignment, Repetition and Proximity Reflection Paragraphs</h2>
    <p>
        The Contrast, Alignment, Repetition and Proximity task was far more about using conventions and certain techniques such as the rule of thirds to create an effective poster to advertise the True/False filmmaking festival. We were encouraged to use found pictures and  were given lots of creative freedom to try and make the best poster possible. Poster 1 was my first design, I decided to make a simple design with colours from the logo. The central placement of the logo is to assist in the coloured division of the page. This allows for it to be split into 2 separate halves though the middle while fitting the logo in with the design. The copy is then split into the two different sections with some information higher up in the red section and the description and small text in the lower section. This creates a hierarchy of the poster and is simple but effective. Poster 2 was my intermediate design. In this poster I decided to use a picture to better emphasise the basis of the festival as a filmmaking celebration. The rule of thirds is also used here but slightly more loosely since there are 3 clear divisions but it is not exactly split into thirds. There is a clear hierarchy with size of text and placement of the copy in the poster relative to the picture in the middle and the other text. It uses the same colour palette as the logo which helps the elements from avoiding looking out of place. Poster 3 is my final design. I think this one is the most aesthetically pleasing and effective poster design. It has some elements from both previous designs and therefore fits the logo in nicely as well as having a picture in the centre. This time the rule of thirds has been used but diagonally. The top section is left empty since its smaller than the bottom section and has some of the space taken by the logo. However, this design also utilises circles such as the logo and the central picture. This adds another design element to the piece. All the information is in the lower section of the page, there isn’t a hierarchy presented by the position of the copy but instead with font sizes. It is clear to see what text is more important and the name of the festival is much larger than the other text which would cause a viewer to view it first.

        My wireframes were the original idea for my website and how it would be structured. In the first image we can see the first three elements of my website, these being my examples of typography and the reflections and the examples of CARP. I think I mostly succeeded in my plan shown. There are a few differences but overall it is quite similar, the alignment of the typography examples was difficult to figure out and so I could not get them to line up in the square fashion I was aiming for but instead I placed 6 on the top line and the other 2 an equal distance from each other on the next line. The same was true with my typography paragraphs. My attempt to put the reflections into boxes didn’t work well or look good so I decided to put it in one large paragraph underneath the examples to create a sort of border between sections which I think looks nice and works for the type of website. My CARP examples went exactly how I wanted them to since it was far easier aligning 3 pictures with captions than it was aligning 8, so this part was far easier. For my second wireframe we are shown the other 3 main elements of my website. It starts with the CARP poster reflection paragraphs and then includes the user experience section and then the final project report. The CARP poster section was difficult since I really struggled to get columns to work within a container and so I again opted to make it a large paragraph which I thought creates a nice base for the CARP examples section and continues consistency from the earlier sections. My user experience section was somewhat easy since aligning 3 pictures with captions is quite easy, however, I again struggled to use the columns I planned to use and so I made the reflection paragraphs for the wireframes into a large paragraph again to fit the rest of the website. I then succeeded in my strategy and scope area since my original plan was to have the section connecting to the wireframe section and then have a title and a paragraph. The project report needed to be the final element on the page since it is the overall evaluation of the project as a whole. I think this bit was one of the easiest bits since all it needs is text and no extra photos or graphics. My flowchart was a design for my scrolling website. It shows the organisation and structure of my page and how the page will flow with the navigation bar at the top. It shows the spacing and the lay out of the website and how I expected it to be.

    <h2>Strategy and Scope</h2>
    
    <p>
        The strategy I took for my website was to start with what needed to be included within the website. I made a list of the important features such as the typography examples and reflection paragraphs, the contrast, alignment, reflection and proximity posters with their reflection paragraphs, the user experience area and the final project report. I decided that each separate element needed a link within the navigation bar and so each section would be separate within my scrolling website. 
I think my users would be designers in need of explanation or inspiration to do with typographic systems and different ways to use the different elements of the CARP task. This would allow them to see examples and explanations of them including which are most effective and aesthetically pleasing which could assist in their decision making process. My goal is to have an easily navigable website with a navigation bar at the top to help the user find what they are looking for. I also am aiming for a neat and spaced out feel to the website so It doesn’t feel chaotic or claustrophobic. To achieve this I made sure to have lots of breaks between sections and space between different lines of copy.
